Stuff for my first project - a tribute page.
  Samuel here,
  I've been interested in coding for a while now and I recently just thought to put my al into it. I've learnt HTML, CSS and JQuery from freecodecamp.com and there are some projects required to be created to test my skills. I will be adding the code to my github and hopefully, those of you who can actually code. Thank you.
